description: Audits and fixes CI/CD pipelines, Docker Compose, deploy scripts, database migrations in production, secrets handling, release artifacts, rollback plans, and PM2 config. Run before any production deploy.
model: sonnet
---

## Auto-trigger conditions
- Changes to `.github/workflows/`, `docker/`, `nginx/`, `ecosystem.config.cjs`
- User asks "will this deploy correctly?" or "is the CI safe?"
- Running `/deploy` or `/release-check`
- Any production deployment is being planned

## MVC layer
Infrastructure layer — audits deployment of all MVC layers together.

## Audit checklist

### GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- [ ] Postgres and Redis services configured with health checks
- [ ] `npm ci` used (not `npm install`) for reproducible installs
- [ ] `prisma generate` runs before typecheck
- [ ] `prisma migrate deploy` used (not `migrate dev` or `db push`)
- [ ] All 3 workspaces typechecked (frontend, backend, shared)
- [ ] Tests run with required env vars set (JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, etc.)
- [ ] Coverage uploaded as artifact
- [ ] Workflow times out in ≤ 20 minutes
- [ ] Secrets accessed via `${{ secrets.NAME }}` only — no plaintext

### GitHub Actions Deploy (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- [ ] Triggered only on `main` branch push (not PR)
- [ ] Build runs BEFORE SSH to server (fail fast locally)
- [ ] Migration runs BEFORE code deploy (new code needs new schema)
- [ ] `prisma migrate deploy` used (never `migrate dev` or `db push`)
- [ ] PM2 `reload` used (not `restart` — zero-downtime)
- [ ] Health check hits `/api/health` after deploy and fails pipeline if 503
- [ ] SCP copies built artifacts — not `git pull` on server

### Docker Compose (`docker/docker-compose.yml`)
- [ ] All ports bound to `127.0.0.1` (not `0.0.0.0`) — Postgres/Redis not publicly exposed
- [ ] Health checks on Postgres (`pg_isready`) and Redis (`redis-cli ping`)
- [ ] Named volumes for data persistence (`postgres_data`, `redis_data`)
- [ ] `.env.docker` loaded from file, not inline in compose
- [ ] No `:latest` tags — pinned to specific versions (e.g. `postgres:16-alpine`)

### Nginx (`nginx/nginx.conf`)
- [ ] HTTP (port 80) → HTTPS redirect
- [ ] SSL certificate configured and valid
- [ ] SPA fallback: `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html`
- [ ] `/api/` proxied to backend with `proxy_pass`
- [ ] `/socket.io/` has `Upgrade` + `Connection` headers for WebSocket
- [ ] Security headers: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`
- [ ] `gzip` enabled for text content types

### PM2 (`ecosystem.config.cjs`)
- [ ] `exec_mode: 'cluster'` in production (multi-core)
- [ ] `max_memory_restart` set (e.g. `500M`)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV: 'production'` in `env_production`
- [ ] `watch: false` in production
- [ ] Log rotation configured

### Rollback plan
Every deploy plan must answer:
1. How to rollback the code (PM2 `pm2 deploy production revert 1` or git revert)
2. Is there a down migration? Is rollback safe for existing data?
3. Rollback time estimate
4. Who approves the rollback

## Output format

```
## DevOps Audit

### CRITICAL
[DEVOPS-001] prisma migrate dev used in CI — will reset production DB
  File: .github/workflows/ci.yml:64
  Fix: Replace with: npx prisma migrate deploy

### HIGH
[DEVOPS-002] Postgres port bound to 0.0.0.0 in docker-compose.yml
  Risk: Postgres exposed to public internet
  Fix: Change to ports: ["127.0.0.1:5432:5432"]

### Score: X/10
```

## Rules enforced
- `rule-database-migrations.md` — production migration safety
- `rule-secrets-policy.md` — no secrets in workflows
- `rule-git-safety.md` — no force-push, approval required
